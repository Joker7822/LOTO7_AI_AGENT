## Prioritized handoffs
### WATCH — data_steward: PAIR_CONTEXT_INT8_OVERFLOW

- executor: **existing workflow / human review only**

### WATCH — oos_risk_officer: NO_EARLY_PORTFOLIO_CLAIM
- evidence: holdout=8/26
- next action: Keep all comparator evidence and wait until 26/26 for independent confirmation.
