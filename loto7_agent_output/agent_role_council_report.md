## Prioritized handoffs
### WATCH — data_steward: PAIR_CONTEXT_INT8_OVERFLOW
- evidence: legacy_int8_corrupted_cooccurrence_cells=27; corrected_int64_corrupted_cooccurrence_cells=0; history_draws=701
- next action: Legacy frozen model remains unchanged. A separately versioned int64 candidate passes independent matrix verification, but needs new pre-registered Future-OOS before any production adoption.
- executor: **existing workflow / human review only**

### WATCH — oos_risk_officer: NO_EARLY_PORTFOLIO_CLAIM
- evidence: holdout=8/26
- next action: Keep all comparator evidence and wait until 26/26 for independent confirmation.
- executor: **existing workflow / human review only**


This is a deterministic role-based auditor, not five independent trained AIs.
It has no authority to update the registered model or interpret reused historical data as new evidence.
